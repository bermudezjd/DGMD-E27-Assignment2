                    <p>Herman was a very cute and adorable puppy, but he got into a lot mischief.  We'd often come home to chewed up furniture and clothing, and Herman hiding underneath a table or blanket.</p>

                    <p>Herman will wade in the water up to his chest, but that's as far as he'll go.  He'll stretch to try and reach a floating ball or stick, but he can't swim.</p>

                    <p>During the summer we'll bring Herman to White Horse beach in Plymouth, MA when we visit the in-laws.  He loves running around on the sand.  He'll even wade into the ocean to try and fetch a rock or stick.</p>

                    <p>Herman is a very playful dog and has made many "little while" friends while out and about.  He seems to particularly like Bulldogs and has several friends that he sees on occassion at the park.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Herman was almost never born.  His mother was about to be put down at a kill shelter in Alabama, but the handlers decided that she was gentle and kind enough to warrant calls to rescue organizations.  Luckily, Peis and Strays of Nashua, NH rescued her and her litter!</li>
                        <li>Herman is one of the most popular dogs at the park he goes to in Weston.  All of the regular walkers know him by name.</li>
                        <li>Herman absolutely loves oranges!  He won't
                        leave your side if you're eating one.</li>
                        <li>One of Herman's favorite activities is to steal socks from the hamper or floor and come and show us while the sock hangs from his mouth.  He gets a kick out of having someone chase him around to get it back.</li>
                        <li>Cat Rock and 40 Acres park in Weston is Herman's daily adventure spot.  You'll often find him romping around in the fields, or hear his distinct bark from afar.</li>
