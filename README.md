# DGMD-E27-Assignment2-Site
Build a 2-3 page responsive website, using the principles discussed this week.  

A responsive website should include a grid system, media queries, and images that resize. 

Your grid system and media queries should be custom-coded. 

The grid system can have as many or as few columns as you require. 

You should include at least two media queries in your CSS. You may have more than this if you require it. 

The images that resize may be a solution that you download. Use one from class, or use another solution you’ve found that you like better. 

The site should include a navigation bar that links the relevant pages together, and it should be available on all pages of the site. 

Write your own content for the site. Please don’t use lorem ipsum or Wikipedia entries. The site can be about anything you want provided it’s work-safe, legal, ethical, and moral. If you are redesigning a page or two from a site, you may use that site’s content. 

Use Sass for managing all CSS in this project. Make good use of variables, mixins, extend, nesting, math, built-in functions, etc. You may use whatever Sass file structure works for you. 

You are not required to use if/else, loops, or write your own functions with Sass, but you’re welcome to do so.
