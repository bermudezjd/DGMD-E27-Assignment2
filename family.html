                    <p>Over the years, Herman has become an integral part of our family.  We've been Herman's parents for nearly four years now, and we've watched him grow into a pleasant, fun loving dog.  He loves people, but gets along with other dogs as well.  He's our first "child" in a sense, as raising him has taught us how to care for another being.  We have no doubt that he will be a terrific "big brother" to our newly arriving daughter.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>We adopted Herman from a rescue organization in New Hampshire called Peis and Strays.  We were so nervous the first night we got him that we could barely sleep.  We thought he was going to cry to be let out of his crate and any noise we heard sent us into a panic.  It turns out the only noise he made was from snoring!</p>

                        <p>Herman is looking very Patriotic here in Ogunquit, Maine.  My wife Shelley actually made the matching collar and leash in the picture.</p>

                        <p>We have to bribe Herman with treats to get him in the bath.  You can probably tell by the picture that he doesn't enjoy being in the tub.</p>
