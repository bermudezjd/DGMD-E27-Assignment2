                <ul>
                    <li>Herman was almost never born.  His mother was about to be put down at a kill shelter in Alabama, but the handlers decided that she was gentle and kind enough to warrant calls to rescue organizations.  Luckily, Peis and Strays of Nashua, NH rescued her and her litter!</li>
                    <li>Herman is one of the most popular dogs at the park he goes to in Weston.  All of the regular walkers know him by name.</li>
                    <li>Herman absolutely loves oranges!  He won't
                    leave your side if you're eating one.</li>
                    <li>One of Herman's favorite activities is to steal socks from the hamper or floor and come and show us while the sock hangs from his mouth.  He gets a kick out of having someone chase him around to get it back.</li>
                    <li>Cat Rock and 40 Acres park in Weston is Herman's daily adventure spot.  You'll often find him romping around in the fields, or hear his distinct bark from afar.</li>
